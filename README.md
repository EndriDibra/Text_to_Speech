# Text_to_Speech
Hello dear friends!
This is a classic project about converting text, (which is taken
as an input by the user), to speech. Speech: machine-voice, by the computer.
The project is written in Python language. I used libraries: gTTS and playsound.
Type on ypur terminal: pip install gTTS, pip install playsound
